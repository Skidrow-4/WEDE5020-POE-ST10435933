<p>Founded in 2015 by John Smith and Bheki Mnisi, who both lived in heavily populated areas that were heavily polluted with plastic materials. They saw a business opportunity in the predicament that would see their community get rid of a pollution problem whilst also turning a profit.
    They started Purepack Solutions, which would reduce plastic waste by creating packaging materials from recycled paper plant plant-based plastics. These biodegradable packaging materials would see a decrease in pollution, and they are eco-friendly.
