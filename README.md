Website Navigation – According to Moody R, 2024. Website navigation refers to how things like your menu, links, and sub-menus are structured and sorted on your website. 
My website will have a menu on the top right of the screen on all web pages and links to other web pages on the home page to allow for easy navigation.
It will also have a web page dedicated to providing information about the business, including its values, vision, and mission statement. There will also be a web page for contact details should customers ever need to get in touch with an agent for more information on our products.
The website will also have a nice welcome message on the homepage just so users can feel comfortable whilst browsing. The colour scheme of the website will be one that is appealing to the eye, meaning it will have calming colours that don’t strain the user's eyes whilst browsing in all lighting conditions.
